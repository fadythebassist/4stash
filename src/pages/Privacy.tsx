          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to 4Stash ("we", "our", or "us"). 4Stash is a personal
            content-saving app that lets you save links, tweets, TikToks,
            Instagram posts, Reddit threads, Threads posts, and other media so
            you can revisit them later. This Privacy Policy explains what data
            we collect, how we use it, and your rights.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>

          <h3>Account Information</h3>
          <p>
            When you sign in with Google, Facebook, or email/password, we
            receive basic profile information (name, email address, profile
            photo) from the authentication provider. We store this in Firebase
            Authentication.
          </p>

          <h3>Content You Save</h3>
          <p>
            URLs, titles, descriptions, thumbnails, and metadata of the content
            you choose to save are stored in Firebase Firestore under your
            account. This data is private to you and not shared with other
            users.
          </p>

          <h3>Threads Content</h3>
          <p>
            4Stash supports saving and previewing Threads posts by URL. When you
            save a Threads post, we fetch and store its metadata (title,
            description, and preview image) using the public Threads embed API.
            We do not require you to connect or log in to a Threads account, and
            we do not post, like, follow, or take any action on the Threads
            platform on your behalf.
          </p>

          <h3>Usage Data</h3>
          <p>
            If you consent, we use Google Analytics to measure aggregate app
            usage such as page views, navigation patterns, and feature
            engagement. We do not use Google Analytics to read the private
            content you save. Firebase Authentication may also use essential
            cookies for session management.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>To authenticate you and maintain your session</li>
            <li>To store and retrieve the content you save</li>
            <li>
              If you opt in, to understand overall app usage and improve the
              product experience
            </li>
            <li>
              To fetch metadata (title, description, preview image) for URLs you
              save — this is done server-side and the URL is sent to our Vite
              proxy endpoint
            </li>
            <li>
              To display rich previews of Threads posts using the public Threads
              embed API
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.</p>
