## Testing Firebase Integration

Once you've set up Firebase (see FIREBASE_SETUP.md):

### 1. Authentication
1. Test real Google Sign-In
2. Verify user appears in Firebase Console > Authentication
3. Test email sign-up with verification

### 2. Data Sync

2. Sign in on device 2 with same account
3. Data should sync automatically

### 3. Offline Behavior
1. Add item while online
2. Disconnect internet
3. Try to add another item
4. Should show appropriate error

### 4. Security Rules
1. Try to access another user's data
2. Should be denied by Firestore rules
3. Check Firebase Console > Firestore > Rules

## Common Issues

### Mock Data Not Persisting
- Check localStorage isn't disabled
- Clear cache: DevTools > Application > Clear storage

### Swipe Gesture Not Working
- Ensure touch events are enabled
- Try on actual mobile device
- Check for JavaScript errors

### Web Share Not Available
- Requires HTTPS
- Only works on supported browsers (Chrome, Edge)
- Must be installed as PWA

### Firebase Connection Issues
- Verify config in FirebaseStorageService.ts
- Check network tab for errors
- Ensure Firestore rules are set
